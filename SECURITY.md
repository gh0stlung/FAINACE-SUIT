## Reporting a Vulnerability

Because this application runs **100% Client-Side** (Offline) with **Zero Backend**, most traditional server-side vulnerabilities do not apply.

However, if you discover a logic flaw in the data handling or LocalStorage encryption:

1.  **Do NOT** open a public issue.
2.  Email the developer directly at: `[wiseve6945@emaxasp.com]`
3.  Include a proof-of-concept.

We pledge to address critical logic flaws within 48 hours.
